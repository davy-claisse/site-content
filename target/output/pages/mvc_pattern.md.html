Mvc pattern

</div>
<p>At the heart of the ActiveWeb project there is an MVC pattern - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a>. ActiveWeb project is an implementation of a famous MVC pattern but adopted for the web.</p>
<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>A model in the ActiveWeb application is represented by custom objects that contain data. These can be <a href="activejdbc">ActiveJDBC</a> models, or any other custom objects which represent information specific to the business domain of the application.</p>
<h2 id="view">View</h2>
<p>View in the ActiveWeb project is represented by <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">FreeMarker</a> templates. While ActiveWeb can be used with other templating frameworks, FreeMarker is currently the only implementation.</p>
<h2 id="controller">Controller</h2>
<p>A controller in ActiveWeb is a Java class which extends class <a href="http://javalite.github.io/activeweb/org/javalite/activeweb/AppController.html">org.javalite.activeweb.AppController</a> and provides one or more public void methods. An instance of such a class is used to process web requests.</p>
